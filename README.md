This is the GitHub profile for [Southern Coalition for Social Justice](https://southerncoalition.org/) (SCSJ).

To date, SCSJ has not had any super advanced coders on staff. Despite this, our research team has recognized the need for open source tools like the ones found here that allow us to overcome the obstacles we face in accessing information/data relevant to our work.

So, if you are visiting this profile from outside of SCSJ, please have some grace for the imperfections you find here :)

The hopes and wishes of this GitHub include:
1. Internal continuity
2. Transparency
3. Shareability/Replicability

The ability to consolidate and disseminate tools here will hopefully allow research at SCSJ to contribute to the building of movements of which we are a part.
